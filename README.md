# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP

Task 3: AI Chatbot with NLP
For Task 3, I built a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing tools such as NLTK.
An AI chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a conversational system designed to understand and respond to user queries in human-like language. Chatbots are widely used in customer service, virtual assistants, and automation processes to enhance user interaction and reduce manual workload.
Objective:
The goal of this task is to develop a chatbot using Python that can process user input, understand intent, and provide appropriate responses. By implementing NLP techniques, the chatbot can improve its ability to interpret and generate meaningful replies.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language: Python
Overall, the internship was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills across different domains in Python.
